"Kek", from "kekeke"/"ㅋㅋㅋ", a Korean onomatopoeia of laughter used similarly to "LOL", is the Korean equivalent of the English "haha". Since this is often used in StarCraft matches, Blizzard, Starcraft’s developers, decided to reference it in World of Warcraft (2004): when a player of the Horde faction types "lol" using the /say messaging command, members of the opposing faction see it as "kek".[67][68] A common misconception is that "kek" originated as a variation of "lel", itself a variation of "lol".[69][70]

During the 2016 United States presidential election, Kek became associated with alt-right politics.[71][72][73][74][75][76] Kek is associated with the occurrence of repeating digits, known as "dubs", "trips", "quads", among other terms, in the sequential codes assigned to posts made on 4chan, as if he had the ability to influence reality through Internet memes.[77]

Online message boards such as 4chan first noted a similarity between Kek and Pepe.[78][79][80][81] The phrase is widely used[82] and 4chan users see Kek as the "'god' of memes".[83] The phrase then became associated with the Egyptian deity of the same name.[82]

"Esoteric Kekism" references the "Esoteric Hitlerism" of writer Savitri Devi.[84] Esoteric Kekism, also called "the Cult of Kek",[85] is a parody religion worshipping Pepe the Frog, which sprang from the similarity of the slang term for laughter, "kek", and the name of the ancient Egyptian frog god of darkness, Kek.[82] This deity, in turn, was associated with Pepe the Frog on internet forums.[82][79] The Internet meme has its origin on the internet message forum 4chan and other chans, and the board /pol/ in particular.[82][86] Kek references are closely associated with Trump and the alt-right,[95] and the Kek-Flag was spotted at the 2021 storming of the Capitol.[96]
